# Fetch Reveals

Turns "new cards dropped" into one PR of verified card data in the app repo. The owner reads
one report and reviews the PR. Design and rationale: Doberjohn/inkweave#571 and
Doberjohn/inkweave#574 (the pipeline), Doberjohn/inkweave-admin#3 (its move to admin).

**Two sources, each doing what it is good at.** lorcanaplayer.com has every card's text and
stats, but it also lists leaks: cards that were never officially revealed. illumineertales.com
is the owner's reference for what is official: one slot per collector number, and a clean
scan of every revealed card, but no text. So a card is only written when the official list
shows it; its text and stats come from lorcanaplayer; its scan, read blind and shipped as
art, comes from the official list.

**Why it is a skill and not a script:** lorcanaplayer.com sits behind Cloudflare. `curl`
and automated browsers get 403 on pages and images alike; only the owner's own Chrome gets
through. So the browser half of this runs through the Claude in Chrome tools, and the rest
is `node scripts/reveal-sync/run.mjs`, which does everything deterministic and is tested
(`pnpm test:run`). The official list is plain HTTPS: `run.mjs` reads it, and downloads
the scans, in Node.

The season (set, size, ink blocks) comes from the pinned app through `src/app-bridge.ts`.
When the app rotates the season, bump the pin (CLAUDE.md, "Updating the app pin") before the
next run. Nothing here needs editing.

## Hard rules

- **Never commit or push by hand.** `write` opens the reveal PR in the app and commits
  `state.json` to admin's `main` itself. The owner reviews and merges the PR.
- **Never write a card the official list does not show as revealed, and never add one by
  hand to get around the gate.** A leak waits, deferred, and is written the day the official
  list shows it. If the official list cannot be read, the run stops; there is no way round it.
- **Never solve, click or wait out a bot check by interacting with it.** If Cloudflare shows
  an interactive challenge, stop and ask the owner to open the page in Chrome themselves.
- **Never give a reader anything but the image path and its directory.** No site values, no
  card name, no other reader's output. Independence is the point. The job list's `READ` line
  names the card for you; the reader's paths deliberately do not, so keep it that way.
- **Never translate a non-English card, and never take rarity or inkable from a reader.**
  The gates and the adjudicator enforce both; do not work around them.
- **Every reader gets its own directory.** Readers that share one read each other's crops
  and transcribe the wrong card. Each job's directory is an anonymous folder holding only
  that reader's copy of the image; use it as given.

## Step 0: Preflight

1. `mcp__claude-in-chrome__list_connected_browsers` must show a connected browser. If not,
   stop: the owner needs to open Chrome with the extension.
2. `gh auth status` must show the owner logged in to github.com: `start` and `write` read and
   write both repos through `gh`.
3. After a pin bump or on a fresh clone, build the engine: `pnpm build:engine`. The house-style
   rules and the write chain load its build output (Doberjohn/inkweave#635), and a stale build
   fails at import with "does not provide an export named".
4. Open the run:

   ```bash
   node scripts/reveal-sync/run.mjs start
   ```

   It prints the run id (`RUN` below) and the exact `discover` call for Step 2. It refuses to
   start while a reveal PR is still open in the app repo: merge or close that one first. It
   reads the app's `previewCards.json` from `master` and admin's `state.json` from `main`, and
   records both blobs so Step 6 can tell if a card was published through the reveal publisher,
   or another run finished, in the meantime.

   It also reads the official list, keeps it for the whole run (`official.json`), and prints
   how many cards it shows plus a **leak audit**: this set's Inkweave cards that the list does
   not show as revealed, or names differently. Show the owner any audit finding; the run never
   changes those cards. If the official list cannot be read (the site is down, its format
   changed, or it has no section for this set), `start` stops with
   `official list unavailable` and opens no run. Tell the owner and stop; do not carry on
   without it.

## Step 1: Open the site and let the check clear

The Cloudflare clearance expires after a few hours, and a page's own `fetch()` cannot renew
it; only a real navigation can.

1. `tabs_context_mcp` with `createIfEmpty: true`, then `navigate` the tab to
   `https://lorcanaplayer.com/cards/`.
2. With `javascript_tool`, wait and check:

   ```js
   await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 6000));
   const probe = await fetch('/cards/', {credentials: 'same-origin'});
   JSON.stringify({title: document.title.slice(0, 60), status: probe.status})
   ```

   Carry on when `status` is 200 and the title is not "Just a moment...". If it stays on
   the check, **stop** and ask the owner to load the page in Chrome themselves.

## Step 2: Install and discover

1. `node scripts/reveal-sync/run.mjs snippet` and pass its output, verbatim, as
   `javascript_tool`'s `text`. It must return `reveal-sync/2`.
2. Run the `discover` call `start` printed. It downloads the set's index as a file and
   returns `{pages, total}`.
3. `node scripts/reveal-sync/run.mjs candidates RUN` reads that file and prints one
   `fetchCards` call per batch of 15. It warns if the site lists fewer cards than last run
   (a page probably failed to load; discover again). `--only slug-a,slug-b` fetches exactly
   the named cards whatever their state, for example to re-check one card.

Navigating the tab wipes the installed code. After any navigation, reinstall before the next call.

## Step 3: Fetch

1. Run each `fetchCards` call in order. Each returns `{fetched, failed}`. No card image is
   downloaded in the browser any more. A `failed` entry ending `:403` means the clearance
   expired mid-run: redo Step 1, reinstall, and rerun that batch.
2. `node scripts/reveal-sync/run.mjs ingest RUN` parses every page, runs the checks,
   downloads each passing card's official scan, prints the report so far, then one `READ`
   job per card that needs a blind read. It saves after every batch, so rerunning it after a
   timeout picks up where it stopped.

A character page with no Strength row reads as Strength 0: lorcanaplayer leaves the row out
when Strength is 0. The reader checks that 0 against the scan like any other stat, so a wrong
one gets more readers and never reaches the data. Any other missing row (Willpower, Lore)
means the site's markup changed, and the card lands in ERRORS as `page-unreadable`.

Before any reader runs, each card is checked, in this order:

1. **Against what Inkweave already holds**, by number **and** name: a number already used by
   another card, or a card already present under a different number or in the reserved band,
   is a conflict rather than a skip or a second copy.
2. **Against the official list**, by collector number, or by name when the page shows no
   number (the official number is then adopted). A card the list does not show as revealed
   is deferred as `not-officially-revealed`: a leak, retried every run. A card that is only
   an official promo needs a reserved-band id. An official reveal with a translation link is
   deferred as not English. A card whose name, ink, type or rarity differs between the two
   sites is an `official-mismatch` for the owner (Step 5). A card whose official entry is
   revealed but cannot be read (the site's format drifted) is deferred as
   `official-entry-unreadable`, never treated as a leak; the report's first lines name those
   entries. A different **version** does not
   stop the card: three readers settle it (Step 4). The official rarity counts only when it
   is one of the five; a blank or `PROMO` rarity there is no opinion.
3. **lorcanaplayer's own gates**: other sets, rarities outside the five, a non-English scan
   marker in the page's image filename, incomplete site records (no card text unless the
   site's ability tags say `None`, a blank version, no classifications), cards with no
   readable collector number, and inks that contradict their collector-number block. The
   ability tags (`Keywords + Abilities`) are lorcanaplayer's own list, not the card's
   keywords, so `Unknown` there holds a card back only when its text is missing too.
4. **The official scan** is downloaded. If the site has no scan at the URL its own page
   builds, nor under lorcanaplayer's name for the card (a renamed card keeps its old
   filename), the card is deferred as `official-image-missing` and retried next run.

## Step 4: Blind reads

For every `READ <slug> r<N>` job, spawn one `Agent` (`general-purpose`), foreground, with
the prompt below, substituting the job's `image` and `dir`. Run up to 8 at a time.

Then `node scripts/reveal-sync/run.mjs adjudicate RUN`. It decides every card whose results
are all in, and prints any new jobs. A card whose reader disagreed with the site gets two
more readers, as does one whose card text or identity (name, version, number, ink, type)
the reader could not read. A classification line or stat the reader could not read goes
straight to the owner in Step 5 instead: more readers of the same pixels rarely recover it.
A card whose version the two sites give differently always gets three readers; the version
two of them read is written, whichever site it came from, with a note either way. A reader
who reads any language code other than EN in the card's footer (however it is written:
`FR`, `French`, `fr-FR`) defers the card as not English. A code no reader could read is
treated like an unreadable identity field: two more readers, then the owner.
Repeat this step until it prints "No reader jobs outstanding".

A job listed again has no usable `result.json`; the listing says why when there is a file
but it is unusable. Rerun that reader. `adjudicate` never decides a card while any of its
readers' results is missing or unusable.

### Reader prompt

```
Read the Lorcana card image at {IMAGE} using the Read tool, and transcribe exactly what is
printed on it.

WORKING DIRECTORY RULE: every temporary file you create (crops, magnifications,
contrast-enhanced copies) MUST be written inside this directory and nowhere else:
{DIR}
Use simple filenames inside that directory. Never write to its parent.

INTEGRITY CHECK: after writing any crop, confirm the file you read back is the one you just
wrote (check its dimensions match what your command produced). If a file's content does not
match what you asked for, stop and report it.

You have NO other information about this card. Do not infer anything from outside the
image. Do not search the web or the repo. Read no file other than the image and the files
you create yourself.

Produce compact JSON with these keys:
- name, version (the subtitle under the name; null for Action/Item/Song)
- cost (top-left gem number)
- strength (characters only), willpower (characters and locations), lore (count of diamond
  pips right of the text box), moveCost (locations only); null where the card has none
- inkColor: frame colour, one of Amber/Amethyst/Emerald/Ruby/Sapphire/Steel (two if dual-ink)
- type: Character/Action/Item/Location
- classifications: the line under the name bar, as printed
- keywords: array of keyword abilities THIS card HAS, with values (e.g. "Singer 5",
  "Shift 3", "Resist +1"). Exclude keywords it merely grants to other characters. Exclude
  ALL-CAPS named ability titles.
- cardText: array, one printed ability per line, INCLUDING keyword reminder text in
  parentheses. EXCLUDE the italic flavour quote at the bottom. Preserve the hexagon (ink),
  diamond (lore) and exert symbols where they appear, writing them as the unicode characters
  you see. If the card has NO rules text at all, return an empty array.
- collectorNumber: the "N/204" at bottom left, or null if not printed
- language: the two-letter language code printed after the collector number at bottom left
  (for example EN, FR, DE, IT, JA, ZH), or null if you cannot read it
- illustrator: the bottom-left credit
- inkable: true if the cost gem has an ornate decorative frame around it, false if plain
- rarityGuess: describe the symbol at bottom centre in a few words; name the rarity only if
  confident

For any field you cannot read with confidence use null and list the key in an "unreadable"
array. Do NOT guess.

Finally, write exactly that JSON, and nothing else, to {DIR}\result.json with the Write
tool, then return the same JSON as your answer.
```

Two clauses are load-bearing: "Do NOT guess" with the `unreadable` array is what produced
honest nulls on a blurred text box instead of invented abilities, and the flavour-text
exclusion keeps non-functional prose out of the data. The `language` key is the only direct
check that the scan Inkweave ships is English: the official list's translation link is not
always set (a French-first reveal once had none).

## Step 5: Conflicts

Show the owner the report's **NEEDS YOUR CALL** section, verbatim.

In the report, `site` always means lorcanaplayer and `official` the official list, the same
words `resolve` takes.

- A field the site and the readers could not settle (`unsettled`) takes the owner's ruling:
  `node scripts/reveal-sync/run.mjs resolve RUN <slug> <field>=site` to take the site's
  value, `<field>=official` for the official list's (it carries the name, version and
  collector number), or `<field>=<value>` for a value they supply (for `text`, separate
  abilities with `\n`). A ruling that does not parse is refused, never written as a blank.
  The report shows each such field as `site "..."; readers ...` (plus `official "..."` when
  the official list gave a different version), with `unreadable` where a reader could not
  make it out. For classifications only the terms matter, not their order. A language code
  no reader could read shows as `language: site "EN"; readers unreadable, ...`: rule
  `language=site` only after checking the scan yourself; a card that is not in English
  simply waits.
- A card the two sites disagree on (`official-mismatch`) shows each field as
  `site "..."; official "..."`. The owner rules on each with
  `node scripts/reveal-sync/run.mjs resolve RUN <slug> <field>=site|official|<value>`, for
  `name`, `ink`, `type` or `rarity`. Once no field is left in dispute, the card gets its
  official scan and a reader in the same run, and `resolve` prints the new `READ` job: run
  Step 4 for it. The readers still check a ruled name, ink and type against the card.
- A card that is only an official promo (`needs-reserved-band`, detail `official promo ...`)
  has no set number yet. Like every other `needs-reserved-band`, `in-reserved-band`,
  `number-taken`, `name-taken` and `ink-block-mismatch`, it needs a fix in the data by hand.
  It stays in the report and is retried on every run. A card with no collector number is
  added with a reserved-band id (see `docs/PREVIEW_CARD_PARSER.md`), and renumbered once the
  site shows its number.
- A card the write chain refuses (`validation-failed`) carries the validator's message as its
  detail, for example `"Strength" is spelled out: use ¤ ("their ¤")` for a glyph word house
  style cannot place (Doberjohn/inkweave#635). `resolve` cannot rule on it, and it is retried
  on every run. Add it by hand in the reveal publisher
  (https://inkweave-admin.vercel.app/reveal), writing the text the way the detail says.

Anything unresolved is simply not written, and is retried next run.

## Step 6: Write and publish

```bash
node scripts/reveal-sync/run.mjs write RUN
```

`write` first checks that the app's `previewCards.json` on `master` and admin's `state.json` on
`main` are still what `start` read, and aborts, writing nothing, if either changed. Then, in an
order that never leaves the card data ahead of its art, it:
- validates each verified card through the same chain the reveal publisher uses
  (`validateRevealCardForm`, `buildPreviewCard`, `insertCardIntoPreviewJson`);
- converts the accepted cards' scans to AVIFs with the app's own converter, never replacing art
  the app already has;
- inserts only the cards whose art converted.

A card whose art fails becomes a conflict and is retried next run. Last, `write` records the
run's outcomes in its copy of `state.json`.

Then it publishes, with nothing in a local checkout:
- a `reveals/set<SET>-<RUN>` branch in the app holding `previewCards.json` and the new AVIFs;
- a PR from it to `master`;
- a commit of the new `state.json` straight to admin's `main`.

If publishing stops part-way, run `write RUN` again. It resumes where it stopped, and never opens
a second PR.

**Card names carry no accents** (the owner's rule, Doberjohn/inkweave#582: "Hector Rivera", "Mama Coco"). lorcanaplayer
and the readers agree on printed accents, so `write` drops them itself: it strips the
combining marks (NFD, then every `\p{M}`) from each card's name and version, and from every
"named X" reference in its text, so a Shift line names the card as Inkweave spells it. A
reference ends with its clause or sentence; a period after a title or an initial ("Mr.",
"P.J.") stays part of the name. Nothing else changes: every other accent in the text stays as
printed, and so does punctuation such as "…". The report's READY TO WRITE and WRITTEN lists
show each card under the name it is written with; other lists keep lorcanaplayer's spelling. Never strip accents by hand after `write`. A later run still recognises the
card: existing-card matching and the leak audit ignore accents.

Show the owner the full report and the PR link, then stop. They review the PR and merge it; the
next run refuses to start while it is open. If they close it unmerged instead, its state commit
must be reverted (`docs/REVEAL_RUNBOOK.md`).

Besides the card sections, the report ends with two lists the owner should see:

- **ON INKWEAVE, CHECK AGAINST THE OFFICIAL LIST**: the `start` leak audit. Cards already
  in Inkweave that the official list does not show as revealed, or shows under another name.
  Removing or renaming one is the owner's call; the run never does it.
- **OFFICIAL, NOT ON LORCANAPLAYER YET**: official cards lorcanaplayer has not added, so
  they come in on a later run. Until a run has fetched every page once, a card lorcanaplayer
  names differently (a translated first reveal) can show here too.

`node scripts/reveal-sync/run.mjs report RUN` reprints the report at any point.

## Cards shown with a non-English scan

The pipeline never writes these, but the owner can have one added by hand: an official reveal
whose only scan is Japanese, German or Italian, shown with that scan as its art and
lorcanaplayer's English name and text. Its card in `previewCards.json` carries `scanLanguage`
(the scan's two-letter code: `"ja"`, `"de"`, `"it"`), which gives it a "See translation" toggle
in the card modal and the lightbox. When its English scan is out and the card is refreshed to
it, delete `scanLanguage`.

`scanLanguage` is the mark's only record (`docs/plans/P3-pipelines.md`, P3-5): admin's
`state.json` needs no `provisional-translation` entry. Until Doberjohn/inkweave#656 lands, the
app's `reveal-set-integrity.test.ts` still compares the mark with the app's frozen copy of
`scripts/reveal-sync/state.json`. So a card marked by hand before then also needs that entry
there. The reveal publisher gets a field for the mark in Doberjohn/inkweave-admin#14.

|---|---|
| Deterministic pipeline | `scripts/reveal-sync/*.mjs`, tests alongside (`pnpm test:run`) |

| One run's files | `%TEMP%/inkweave-reveal-sync/<RUN>/`: `run.json`; `preview.json` and `state.json` (the base `start` read, then the state as `write` left it); `official.json` (the official list as `start` read it); `cards/<slug>/` (site record, official scan); `blind/<token>/` (one per reader); `out/` (what the PR commits). `REVEAL_SYNC_RUNS` overrides |
| GitHub | `gh`, logged in as the owner: `Doberjohn/inkweave` at `master` (`REVEAL_SYNC_APP_BASE` overrides) and `Doberjohn/inkweave-admin` at `main` (`REVEAL_SYNC_STATE_BRANCH` overrides) |
| Art conversion | the app's `scripts/convert-preview-images.mjs` at the pin, run from a copy in `.reveal-sync-convert/<RUN>/` and removed afterwards |
| Official list | `https://illumineertales.com/cards.json` (`REVEAL_SYNC_OFFICIAL_ORIGIN` overrides the origin) |
